# Image Reconstruction Using CNN Based Upsampling

This project involves a Python program that performs downsampling of images, converts them to the YUV color space, and then upsamples them using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Prerequisites

To install all required packages run the following command: <br/>
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

## Usage

1. Define the input image at the top of the main.py file
2. Run ```python3 main.py```
